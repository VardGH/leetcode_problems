## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
\`\`\`
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
\`\`\`
**Output:** \`3\`
**Explanation:** The longest path is **3 → 20 → 7**, which has a depth of **3**.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
\`\`\`
root = [1,null,2]
\`\`\`
**Output:** \`2\`
**Explanation:** The longest path is **1 → 2**, which has a depth of **2**.
