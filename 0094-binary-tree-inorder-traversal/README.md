# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, this code aims to return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

### Examples:

- **Example 1:**

    Input: `root = [1,null,2,3]`\
    Output: `[1,3,2]`

- **Example 2:**

    Input: `root = []`\
    Output: `[]`

- **Example 3:**

    Input: `root = [1]`\
    Output: `[1]`

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- Node values are in the range of [-100, 100].

## Follow-up

A recursive solution to this problem is trivial, but this code implements the solution iteratively.
